### This Module 2 solution showcases a responsive web design approach tailored for presenting a menu. The HTML structure includes sections for Chicken, Beef, and Sushi, each designed to adapt seamlessly across different device sizes.

* Single Responsive Page: The system is designed as a single page that dynamically adjusts its layout based on the screen width of the device, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

* CSS File and Folder Structure: I have included a separate CSS file and organized it within a 'css' folder under the solution container folder, adhering to best practices for clean structure and presentation separation.

* No Framework Usage: I made sure not to rely on any CSS or JavaScript frameworks, including Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework, to maintain a customized and independent implementation.

* Media Queries and Breakpoints: Utilizing media queries, I established breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views, allowing the layout and design to adapt dynamically to different screen sizes.

* Layout Variations:

  - Desktop View: Sections are equally spaced and occupy the entire row, with width adjustments based on browser window size.
  - Tablet View: The layout features two sections sharing a row and a third section taking up a full row below them, optimizing space for different device sizes.
  - Mobile View: Each section is displayed on its own row, maximizing readability and user interaction on smaller screens.

* Section Title Region: I ensured consistency by including a title region in each section, positioned at the top right corner across all views using relative and absolute positioning techniques.

* Spacing, Borders, and Colors: Careful attention was given to spacing between sections, edges of the browser window, and text elements within sections. Borders were set, and background colors were chosen to enhance visual appeal while maintaining text readability.

* Font Styling (Optional): While not mandatory, I provided the option to set a specific font-family for text elements to further customize the typography. Font sizes were adjusted to establish hierarchy and improve readability across different screen sizes.
